## Summary and Reflection

Integration of the News API to fetch and display news based on user preferences like country, category, and keyword searches. It uses cached_network_image for smooth image loading and caching, which makes scrolling through news articles feel seamless. The google_fonts package gives the app a clean, modern look by making it easy to use stylish fonts. For storing bookmarks, shared_preferences is used, allowing users to save articles they like and access them later, even if they close and reopen the app. One of the cool features is the in-app WebView for reading full articles without leaving the app. Overall, it's a user-friendly news app with a good mix of features and smooth performance. 
But I ran into some issues connecting the external data sources and handling local data persistence. Getting the News API to fetch the articles was a bit tricky, especially making sure the right data showed up for different filters like country and category. There were also hiccups with the shared_preferences package when saving and loading bookmarks—it didn't always store the data correctly. Plus, I had a hard time getting the in-app WebView to load some articles smoothly. Overall, these bugs made it a challenge to create a seamless experience for users.


Working on this app was a mixed bag of fun and challenges. I really enjoyed playing around with the google_fonts and cached_network_image packages—they made the app look great and run smoothly. But, some parts were pretty frustrating, like getting the News API to play nice with all the filters and making sure bookmarks were saved correctly with shared_preferences. I also struggled with setting up the WebView to display articles without any glitches. If I had known how tricky these parts would be, I might have planned differently or chosen other tools. Still, it was a great learning experience and definitely a good challenge!
